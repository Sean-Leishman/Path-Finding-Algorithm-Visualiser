# Path Finding Algorithm Visualiser
Source code for a website that is capable of generating a maze and then using the A* search algorithm to find a path from random start and finish points. This can be viewed at the [website](https://sean-leishman.github.io/path-finding-algorithm-visualiser/) hosted by Github Pages. Now built with addional color grading to visualise the depth of the maze.
